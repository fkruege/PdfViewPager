This is a fork of https://github.com/voghDev/PdfViewPager/ so thanks to him for the original development work.

I forked it because I felt the original had too many extras integrated into it and I just wanted to focus on PDF rendering.
Also, the original implementation suffered from poor render quality and also bitmap memory allocation errors.
